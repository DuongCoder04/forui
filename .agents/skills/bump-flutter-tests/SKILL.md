description: Bump the forui commit pinned in the flutter/tests customer test registry

Bump `registry/forui.test` in flutter/tests to the forui commit tagged `forui/$0`.

The fork lives at `../tests` (`origin` = Pante/tests, `upstream` = flutter/tests). Never add `Co-Authored-By` or
`Generated with` lines to commits or the PR body: the Google CLA bot rejects them.

## Step 1: Resolve the commit

```
cd forui && git fetch origin --tags
git rev-parse forui/$0^{commit}
git diff --stat <old sha> <new sha> -- customer_test.sh customer_test.bat customer_test_setup.sh customer_test_setup.bat
```

`<old sha>` is the current `checkout` line in `../tests/registry/forui.test`. Stop if the tag does not exist. If the
diff is non-empty, mention the script changes in the PR body.

## Step 2: Update the registry

```
cd ../tests && git fetch upstream
```

- No open bump PR: `git checkout -b forui-update-hash upstream/main`.
- Open bump PR (`gh pr list -R flutter/tests --author Pante --search "forui"`): `git checkout forui-update-hash` and
  amend its single commit instead of adding a new one.

```
sed -i '' 's/<old sha>/<new sha>/' registry/forui.test
git add registry/forui.test && git commit -m "Update git hash for duobaseio/forui"   # or --amend --no-edit
git push -u origin forui-update-hash                                               # add --force-with-lease if amended
```

## Step 3: Wait for CI

Find the main-branch "Forui Build" run for `<new sha>` and wait for it:

```
gh run list -R duobaseio/forui --commit <new sha> --workflow "Forui Build" --branch main \
  --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId'
gh run watch -R duobaseio/forui <run id> --exit-status
gh run view -R duobaseio/forui <run id> --json jobs -q '.jobs[] | select(.name == "Build & test (main channel)") | .url'
```

If the run fails, report which jobs failed and stop. Do not open or edit the PR with a red job.

## Step 4: Open or update the PR

Create with `gh pr create -R flutter/tests --base main --head Pante:forui-update-hash` and the title
`Update git hash for duobaseio/forui`, or `gh pr edit <number> -R flutter/tests` if one is open. Body:

```
Updates the pinned commit for `registry/forui.test` from `<old sha (8)>` to [`<new sha (8)>`](https://github.com/duobaseio/forui/commit/<new sha>), the commit on `duobaseio/forui` main tagged `$0`.

- The [main channel CI job](<job url>) for this commit passes.
- The customer test scripts (`customer_test_setup.*`, `customer_test.*`) are unchanged since the previously pinned commit.
